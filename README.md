# Twentyseventeen-child

Twentyseventeen is one of the best out Wordpress themes I've seen in a while. That said, I wanted to make some tweaks. In addition to style changes I wanted an opportunity to practice my git skills. Consider this repo a permanent work in progress as I become more comfortable with Wordpress development and version control.
